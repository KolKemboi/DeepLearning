# Face Recognition Using Tensorflow and OpenCV

After manipulating my friends to let me take videos of Them, I managed to use OpenCV to convert from a video file to an image sequences of them.
Due to privacy, I will not be sharing the datasets, but you are welcome to cloning the model and replacing the appropriate parts to suite your project.

I have linked one of the participants github in the acknowledgemets : Kennedy Karuri
