# Deep Learning

This repository contains code for deep learning models built using Tensorflow and Pytorch.
It is majorly based around convolution Neural Networks, hence the extensive use of OpenCV.


## Tech Stack



**Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:** Open Computer Vision
**Deep Learning Framework:** Tensorflow and Pytorch
